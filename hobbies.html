					<h3>Visiting Elderly</h3>
					<p>Over the past year or so, I've been visiting a 94 year old woman with whom I became very close friends with. The age gap never stops us from having lots of laughs. We constantly discover that we have plenty to learn from one another.</p>

					<h3>Cooking</h3>
					<p>When I have free time, I can usually be found in the kitchen. I love discovering new recipes and adapting them to become even better than the original.</p>

					<h3>Volleyball</h3>
					<p>I would play volleyball everyday if I could. I love the teamwork that this sport involves and the thrilling feeling of spiking the ball off of a beautiful set.</p>

					<h3>Skateboard</h3>
					<p>I wish I had more time to skateboard because when I do, I really enjoy it. I love the freedom of being able to go wherever I want and the feeling of the wind blowing through my hair.</p>
