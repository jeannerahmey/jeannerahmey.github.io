						 My name is Jeanne Rahmey, I graduated from Yeshivah of Flatbush High School. From there I studied in Israel for the year where I explored my Jewish culture. I went on to study at The New School and eventually transferred to New York University where I found the learning to be more academically stimulating and fit for me. As of now, I am pursuing a major in computer science and a minor in web programming and applications.

						A few years ago, I worked at H.I.S International where I was a part of the graphic design team, mostly working on Adobe Illustrator. I absolutely love to travel. I was fortunate enough to work as an intern at Ovation Vacations, a travel agency in New York, where I planned trips, visited hotels, and managed social media. I also made professional slideshows using Final Cut Pro for a company called Vids By Vic. I am currently in the works of starting my own slideshow business. I work as a volleyball coach for the Yeshivah of Flatbush high school volleyball team where I am able to transform my absolute favorite sport into a job.

						On Fridays I enjoy visiting an elderly woman that overtime has truly become one of my closest friends. Every other Sunday I pick up a little girl that is having a tough time at home and give her the fun that every kid deserves. When I have free time, I can usually be found playing volleyball, skateboarding, or cooking.
